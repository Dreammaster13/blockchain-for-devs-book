# Exercises: Playing with Jaxx Wallet on the Ethereum Ropsten Testnet

In this lesson we learned the basic types of **cryptocurrency**
**wallets** and how to make **transactions** with them. During the
exercise you will **install** and **run** several different **wallets**
and then send transactions on the Ethereum **testnet** in order to get
familiar with the process.

Install and Run Jaxx Wallet
---------------------------

1.  Open [https://jaxx.io](https://jaxx.io/)

2.  ![](/assets/exercises-playing-with-jaxx-wallet-022.png)Download the Chrome extension and accept the **End
    User License Agreement**:

Configure the Wallet, Send and Receive coins
--------------------------------------------

1.  Click on **"Create New Wallet"**

2.  ![](/assets/exercises-playing-with-jaxx-wallet-025.png)Set Express installation and choose
    **Bitcoin (BTC)** and **Ethereum (ETH)**:

3.  Select **"Menu"** -\> **"Wallets"**.

4.  ![](/assets/exercises-playing-with-jaxx-wallet-02.png)Add **Bitcoin Test** and **Ethereum
    Test** wallets (**BTCt**, **ETHt**):

5.  Check your Ethereum testnet address (at the wallet main screen):

![](/assets/exercises-playing-with-jaxx-wallet-05.png)Now you are ready to receive some test
    **ETHt** coins. Go to **MetaMask** and send some Ethereum Ropsten
    Testnet coins (ETHt) to your new **Jaxx** wallet address:

7.  Wait for your transaction to be mined (e.g. 1-2 minutes) and check
    your **Jaxx** **ETHt** wallet to see the received Ethereum test
    coins. You can now start trading with the others around you:

**Note:** **ETHt** addresses in **Jaxx** change every time you receive
some coins on them. **Jaxx** is **masking** your current address, so no
one from the testnet can see where the funds are going to. Anyway, when
you are sending coins through the testnet it will appear as though you
send them through your **ETH** wallet. We will see this in the next
exercise. Now just send some coins to other wallets.

8.  ![](/assets/exercises-playing-with-jaxx-wallet-011.png)Send some **Ethereum** to someone
    around you. Set the amount and check the details of your
    transaction:

9.  You can see your transaction history at the bottom of the screen:

Check your Transactions at Etherscan
------------------------------------

1.  Open [https://etherscan.io](https://etherscan.io/)

2.  Copy our current **EthereumTest** Address from **Jaxx** and paste it
    in the search field:

![](/assets/exercises-playing-with-jaxx-wallet-015.png)Note that nothing is showing. This is
    because we are not working on the **real network**, but on a
    **testnet**.

4.  ![](/assets/exercises-playing-with-jaxx-wallet-017.png)Go to **MISC** and then select
    **Testnet** (**Ropsten**):

5.  Now paste your address again to see the information for your
    transactions:

![](/assets/exercises-playing-with-jaxx-wallet-020.png)Now take your real **ETH** wallet
    address from **Jaxx** and check with it:

Here you can see all your OUT transactions in the **testnet**, even
though you are looking with your real **ETH** address. This is because
**Jaxx** is using your real **ETH** address for all transactions, but
gives you masked other addresses for incoming transactions, so it is
harder for someone to track you on the testnet.

What to Submit?
===============

Submit as exercise outcome the **URL of your Ethereum address** in the
Ropsten network at EtherScan, e.g.:

-   <https://ropsten.etherscan.io/address/0x09cdb96b51f725a397f941184d0540b1005fd869>

You should see some **ETHt** in your balance, as well as some
transaction history of ETHt transfers.
