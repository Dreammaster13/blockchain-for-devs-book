# The Meaning of Decentralization
![](/assets/decentralization-and-consensus-algorithms-the-meaning-of-decentralization-01.png)


# Centralized, Distributed and Decentralized
- **Centralized**
  - A single (central)unit of processing
- **Distributed**
  - Pieces of **transaction processing** are done in different places
  - **Distributed** processors are under the control of a **single entity**
- **Decentralized** (peer-to-peer)
  - Not one **single entity**has control over all the processing
![](/assets/decentralization-and-consensus-algorithms-centralized-distributed-and-decentralized-01.png)


# Three Reasons for Decentralization
- **Immutability**
  - Once data is stored, it cannot be manipulated later
  - Much harder to collude and to act in fraudulent way
- **Fault tolerance**
  - Less likely to fail accidentally
- **Attack resistance**
  - More expensive to attack

# Peer-to-Peer Networks
![](/assets/decentralization-and-consensus-algorithms-peer-to-peer-networks-01.png)


# Peer-to-Peer Networks
- **Blockchain networks**consist of interconnected **nodes**
  - Nodes are connected as **peer-to-peer** network
- The **peer-to-peer networking**layer (p2p layer) of blockchain
  - Usually follow the **DHT** (distributed hash tables) paradigm
  - DHT-based p2p networks **scales extremely well**, and survives nodes to arrivals, departures, and failures
- Examples of p2p network layers
  - Kademlia (used in Ethereum)
  - Lib2p2 (used in IPFS)


# Peer-to-Peer Networks

# Peer-to-Peer Networks
- **Gossip Protocol**
  - **Communication protocol**
  - Used by **modern distributed**systems
    - Search Engines, Social Networks, Torrents and **Blockchain**
  - Used to **spread** the information between **Nodes**

![](/assets/decentralization-and-consensus-algorithms-consensus-algorithms-02.png)


# What is Consensus Algorithm?
- **Consensus algorithm**(consensus protocol / consensus mechanism)
  - Algorithm to reach **agreement** among the blockchain nodes
  - All nodes should agree about the **changes** in the distributed ledger
- **Proof-of-work** (PoW), **Proof-of-stake** (PoS), other algorithms
![](/assets/decentralization-and-consensus-algorithms-what-is-consensus-algorithm-01.png)


# Consensus Algorithms - Requirements
- **Byzantine Fault Tolerance**
- Consensus should be reached even when some of the nodes are dishonest
- **Attack Resistance**
- A successful attackshould require a lot of resources
![](/assets/decentralization-and-consensus-algorithms-consensus-algorithms-requirements-01.png)
![](/assets/decentralization-and-consensus-algorithms-consensus-algorithms-requirements-02.png)


<!-- # Byzantine Fault Tolerance (B -->
- **Byzantine** **Fault Tolerance** (**BFT**) is an important characteristic of distributed systems
- **Safely** communication across the **Network**
- Reach **consensus** despite any **faulty** **Nodes**
- Used in **Blockchain** and many **critical** **systems**
  - **Airplane** **engines** and **Nuclear** **Power** plants
- **Secured** in **Blockchain** by **Consensus** **Algorithms**


# Attack Resistance
- **Incorrect** **Behavior**
- **Honest** **Nodes** should **always** Win
- **Cheap** to **verify** the correctness
- **Expensive**to attack
- **Shouldn’t** slow the network
![](/assets/decentralization-and-consensus-algorithms-attack-resistance-01.png)


<!-- # Proof-of-Work (P -->
- A "**proof - of - work**" (PoW) is a piece of data which is:
  - **Difficult** to produce (by someone)
  - **Easy** to **verify** (by all others)
- Producing a **proof-of-work**can be a random guessing process
  - Or can be organized in **mining pools**(joint PoW production)
- Example:
  - Find a number **x**, such that **SHA256( text + x )** has 10 leading zeroes
  - 10 zeroes == network difficulty
![](/assets/decentralization-and-consensus-algorithms-proof-of-work-pow-01.png)


# Proof-of-Work: Problems
- Needs **computing power**
  - Computationally expensive
  - Energy intensive
- **51% attack**
  - Attackers holding more than 50% of the power could potentially reverse-back transactions & **double-spend** money / deny service
- **Hashing algorithm types**for PoW consensus
  - **ASIC** mineable (e.g. SHA256), **CPU** mineable (e.g. CryptoNight), **GPU** mineable (e.g. ETHash)

![](/assets/decentralization-and-consensus-algorithms-proof-of-work-problems-02.png)


<!-- # Proof-of-Work: Problems -->
- Transactions **speed** – average wait time
  - **Bitcoin**: new block mined in ~ **9-10 minutes**
  - **Ethereum**: new block mined in ~ **10-15 seconds**
  - Business needs **real-time transactions**(milliseconds)
- Transactions **throughput** – transactions per second (tps)
  - **Bitcoin**: 2000-3000 / transactions per block &rarr; **3-5 tps**(up to 7 tps)
  - **Ethereum**: 200-300 / transactions per block &rarr; **10-15 tps**
  - Business needs **thousands tps**(e.g. VISA performs 2000 tps)

<!-- # Proof of Stake (P -->
- **PoS**is designed to increase blockchain **network security**and reduce **resource wasting**
- The creator of the next **block** is chosen in
  - Random selection, proportional to his **wealth**
  - E.g. holding 1% of the coins gives the chance toverify (mine) 1% of the "Proof of Stake" blocks
- **The "Monopoly Problem"**: a monopolist (holder of the most coins) could double spend or deny / filter other's transactions
  - Executing a **monopoly attack**is much more expensive than in PoW
![](/assets/decentralization-and-consensus-algorithms-proof-of-stake-pos-01.png)


<!-- # Leased Proof of Stake (LP -->
- In **Leased PoS** users can choose:
  - To be a **full node** or **lease** their stake
- **Full nodes** maintain the network
  - Process **transactions**and generate new blocks
  - PoS based on: **own stake**+ **leased stake**
  - Serve as **mining pools**(collect fees and distribute the profits)
- Most users **lease their stake** to full nodes
  - Take a **portion** from the full node's profits, just like in pool mining

<!-- # Delayed Proof of Work (DP -->
- **Hybrid Consensus Algorithm** 
  - Combines **Proof Of Work**and **Proof of Stake**
- **Two**types of**Nodes**
  - **Notary Nodes( PoS )**and**Normal Nodes( PoW )**
- **Notary Nodes**mine on lower difficulty
- **Reduced** **Electricity** usage
- Can operate **without** any **Notary** **Nodes**


# Variations of Proof of Stake
![](/assets/decentralization-and-consensus-algorithms-variations-of-proof-of-stake-01.png)


<!-- # Delegated Proof of Stake (DP -->
- **Stakeholders** vote for **delegates** in democratic way
  - Every **wallet** holding **coins** can **vote** for **delegates**
  - Votes **weight** is proportional to the wallet's **stake** in the network
- Delegates generate **new blocks**(like miners in PoW)
  - **Validate** transactions and take the fees as profit
  - **Maintain** the blockchain, e.g. vote for changing the network parameters like block intervals, transaction fees, others
  - Very **fast** confirmation of transactions (2-3 secs)

<!-- # Proof of Importance (P -->
- **PoI** is similar to PoS, where **stakes** are based on coins + activity
- The mining power calculated by the **importance in the network**
  - More **coins** hold for long time &rarr; bigger importance (like a stake)
  - More **transactions** / activities &rarr; bigger importance
![](/assets/decentralization-and-consensus-algorithms-proof-of-importance-poi-01.png)


<!-- # Proof of Burn (P -->
- **PoB** is similar to PoS, where **stakes** are based on burned coins
- **Burning coins**gives the privilege to **mine** 
  - **Burn** coins by sending them to a burningaddress (where they are irretrievable)
  - More **coins** you **burn** &rarr; better chanceto be selected to **mine** the **next block**
  - **Random** selection process (weighted)
- Like traditional mining &rarr; invest money to get mining power
  - **PoW** &rarr; invest in hardware; **PoB** &rarr; invest in burning coins
![](/assets/decentralization-and-consensus-algorithms-proof-of-burn-pob-01.png)


<!-- # PBFT (Practical Byzantine Fault Toleran -->
- **PBFT** as a leader-based blockchain consensus algorithm
  - Nodes collecting transactions, select a **leader** for the next block
    - Can be random (deterministic) or random based on a stake
  - The leader**orders the transactions** + broadcasts the ordered list
  - Each node **validates** / executes the transactions + broadcasts the calculated **hash** of the new block
  - When **2/3**of the nodes have the **same hash**
    - The new block is published (mined)
  - Very fast on **Small** **Networks**
  - Slow on bigger ones, because of **MAC** communication

# Proof of Capacity (PoC) / Proof of Space
- Similar to PoW, but based on **HDD**, not CPU / GPU
  - **Pay** for mining with hard drive space
  - More **hard drive space**&rarr; betterchance of **mining** the **next block**
- Calculating hashes is slow, so hashesare stored in the HDD for faster access
  - **Plots** – large data files holding of precomputed **hashes**
  - More **plots** &rarr; better your chance of finding the **next block**
  - **Plot size**is similar to **hash rate**in PoW
![](/assets/decentralization-and-consensus-algorithms-proof-of-capacity-poc-proof-of-space-01.png)


<!-- # Proof of Authority (P -->
- **Proof-of-Authority** (**PoA**) assigns a set of **trusted nodes** (authorities) to process transactions and build new blocks
  - News blocks need to be **signed by the majority**of authorities
  - Works very well in **private blockchains** (cross validation)
  - Great **performance**, fast transactions, high throughput
- Examples:
  - POA Network – https://poa.network 
  - Ethereum Rinkeby Testnet – https://www.rinkeby.io
![](/assets/decentralization-and-consensus-algorithms-proof-of-authority-poa-01.png)


<!-- # Proof of Elapsed Time (Po -->
- **PoET** relies on a **trusted execution environment (TEE)**
  - Supported by modern CPUs from Intel, AMD and ARM
  - No **cryptographic puzzle**(like in PoW algorithms)
  - Implemented in **Hyperledger Sawtooth**
- PoET ensures **blocks** get produced in a random lottery fashion
  - Generates securely the **next block**+ a **proof of the waiting time**inside the TEE
  - The proof of waiting time can be verified by all other nodes
- Problem: a small subset of **compromised nodes**can compromise the entire system
![](/assets/decentralization-and-consensus-algorithms-proof-of-elapsed-time-poet-01.png)


# Consensus Algorithm's Performance
- General assumptions about the consensus algorithms:
- **Smaller groups** of nodes achieve consensus **faster** 
- Consensus between **thousands** of nodes (e.g. Ethereum) is **more decentralized** than between 10-20 nodes (e.g. NEO, Steem, EOS)
- DPoS / LPoS / dBFT / PoA (like EOS, NEO, NEM) are **faster** and **less safe**than PoW mining (Bitcoin, Ethereum)
  - Less nodes &rarr; faster consensus, smaller block time, better throughput
- **Private** blockchains are faster than **public** blockchains


# Starting a New Blockchain Network
- When a new blockchain is started
  - It may **initially distribute its coins** among its participants
  - If a single entity holds most coins, the trust will be reduced
- Typical blockchain start: **ICO** / **token sale**
  - E.g. **TRON** starts by ERC20 token, then convert tokens to TRX coins
- Alternative blockchain start: **hard-fork existing blockchain**
  - E.g. **Bitcoin Gold**and**Litecoin**forked the original Bitcoin network
- Or start by **empty chain**with PoW miners, e.g. **Bitcoin**, **Monero**


# From PoW to PoS Consensus
- Proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchains either
  - Start from a **PoW algorithm**to mine initial amounts of currency
    - Later **switch** to proof-of-stake, relying on the existing stakes
    - Example: **Ethereum** (ethereum.org)
  - Or **fork**existing PoW blockchain with all its transactions,and introduce a PoS-based consensus
    - Example: **PIVX** (pivx.org) forked from **Dash**
  - Or run a **hybrid PoW + PoS** consensus mechanism (Casper FFG)

# DAG / Tangle / IOTA
- Tangle == **blockless** distributed ledger
  - Based on **DAG** (directed acyclic graph)
  - Used by **IOTA** – iota.org 
- Transactions with **zero fees**
  - Validate 2 transactions to get your transaction validated for free
- Store data from sensors and dataloggers securely and verified
  - **Scalable** – more nodes add more processing power
  - **Lightweight** – validators don't need the entire blockchain
![](/assets/decentralization-and-consensus-algorithms-dag-tangle-iota-01.png)


# IOTA is Semi-Centralized
- Uses **Tangle** **Algorithm**
- **Nodes** chain transaction to **two** **previous** **transaction** in the DAG
- A **central node**(called **coordinator**, closed-source) runs per 1 minute to confirm the transactions and make them final
![](/assets/decentralization-and-consensus-algorithms-iota-is-semi-centralized-01.png)


# HashGraph
- Superior distributed ledger technology system
  - https://hashgraph.com
- **Gossip** **Protocol** Consensus Algorithm
- **Fast**: with a very high throughputand low consensus latency
- **Secure**: asynchronous byzantinefault tolerant (async BFT)
- **Fair**: fairness of access, ordering,and timestamps
- Used in **Private** **Blockchains**
![](/assets/decentralization-and-consensus-algorithms-hashgraph-01.png)


# HashGraph: Problems
- Major problems stop Hashgraph from real use:
  - Hashgraph is **patented technology**
    - Not open to use and extend like Bitcoin
  - Hashgraph is **not open-source**
    - It might have hidden bugs / backdoors / other problems
    - It's community is limited and closed
  - No **public ledger** (like Ethereum and Bitcoin) is built leveraging the Hashgraph consensus
    - Thus Hashgraph cannot be Ethereum's competitor


# Red Belly Blockchain
- Red belly blockchain – redbellyblockchain.io 
  - High-performance consensus protocol for consortium blockchains
    - **Consortium blockchain**== everyone can read, only pre-selected set of nodes can propose and validate transactions
  - Superior **performance**: 600 000 tps @ 300 nodes
    - Confirmations after 4 seconds, un-forkable
  - http://gramoli.redbellyblockchain.io/web/doc/talks/facebook.pdf
  - Open-source implementation in Go and Java: https://hades.it.usyd.edu.au/henryhan/RBBC-Client-Java


# Blockchain Network Forks
- Hard Fork and Soft Fork
![](/assets/decentralization-and-consensus-algorithms-blockchain-network-forks-01.png)


# Hard Fork
- **Hard fork**== **loosening** the network rules
  - Makes previously invalid **blocks / transactions** valid
  - **Nodes** running previous versions no longer accept
- Hard forks split the blockchain into 2 parallel networks
  - One path follows the **new blockchain**(e.g. Bitcoin Gold)
  - Other path continues along the **old blockchain**(e.g. Bitcoin)
- **Requires all nodes**to upgrade and agree on the new version
- Not backward-compatible (unidirectional)


# Hard Fork Example: Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash
![](/assets/decentralization-and-consensus-algorithms-hard-fork-example-bitcoin-and-bitcoin-cash-01.png)


# Why Hard Fork is Needed?
- Correct important **security risks**found in older versions of the software (including proven fraud, like the DAO hack)
- Add **new functionality** (incompatible with the old versions)
- **Reverse transactions** (after heavy community debate)
![](/assets/decentralization-and-consensus-algorithms-why-hard-fork-is-needed-01.png)


# Bitcoin Hard Forks
- **SegWit2x** – cancelled
![](/assets/decentralization-and-consensus-algorithms-bitcoin-hard-forks-01.png)


# Ethereum Hard Forks
- The **DAO Hack**
  - Bug in a smart contract "**TheDAO**" code caused a hacker to steal 3.6 millions ETH
- The **Ethereum** platform has been hard-forked into: 
  - **Ethereum Classic** (old) &rarr; the blockchainshould stay immutable forever (**code is law**)
  - **Ethereum** (new) &rarr; ethically wrong / fraudulenttransactions can be reverted by community voting
![](/assets/decentralization-and-consensus-algorithms-ethereum-hard-forks-01.png)


# Soft Fork
- **Soft fork**== **restricting** the network rules
  - Such that updated versions are **backwards compatible**
  - The old software will recognize any new blocks
  - No fork of the blockchain, no change in transactions and blocks
- Requires only a**majority**of the nodes to upgrade
  - Old nodes will still accept blocks created by new nodes
  - Not following the new rules (and this will not break the network)
- Soft fork example: BIP66 &rarr; change in the signatures format


# Why Soft Fork is Needed ?
- To **implement new**and **upgraded** functionalities that are**backwards compatible**
![](/assets/decentralization-and-consensus-algorithms-why-soft-fork-is-needed-01.png)


# Summary
