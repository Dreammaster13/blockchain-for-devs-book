# Exercises: Buy a Drink Using Lightning Web Wallet

The goal of this exercise is to play with the Lightning Network on the
Bitcoin Testnet and make some off-chain transactions. The easiest way is
to use [htlc.me](https://htlc.me/) wallet. We will buy a drink from
[starblocks](https://starblocks.acinq.co/#/). You don't need to install
anything.

Notice : If you have a problem with Starblocks you can try different
Lightning payment website:

Setup the Lightning Desktop Application
=======================================

Go to [htlc.me](https://htlc.me/) website. The website will create a
wallet for you with 0.00016000 tBTC. Save your **Recovery phrase** in
safe place after that press **\[Got it, I wrote it down!\]** and you
will be redirected to your wallet.

Send Coins to Colleague
=======================

Now exchange money with your colleague or use incognito and transfer
money between your wallets. First you need to **request** money. You
need to fill the amount and the website will make **unique hash** which
represent Invoice. When you send to someone and he write it, he will
make transaction for this **amount** to your **address**.
