# Order Book

![](/assets/cryptocurrency-exchanges-order-book-01.png)


# Margin Trading
- **Margin** **trading** == using borrowed funds from a broker to trade a financial asset, which forms the collateral for this loan
- Needs a **margin account**
- **Maintenance margin**== minimal amount of **equity** maintainedby the investor
- Financial leverage magnify **gains** and **losses**

# Limit Order
- **Limit Order** == order to buy or sell at a specified price **or better**
- It **may not be executed**if the price cannot be met 
- Can have a **time expiration** period
![](/assets/cryptocurrency-exchanges-limit-order-01.png)


# Market Order
- Buy/sell **at best price** currently available
- **Match** against order book entries
  - Final price will be weighted average of what you matched with
- Might be **more expensive** compared to limit order
  - Market maker / market taker fees
![](/assets/cryptocurrency-exchanges-market-order-01.png)


# Stop-Loss Order
- **If** price reaches a certain level, **then** place a Limit/Market Order
- **Different** from Limit Order
  - You don’t want to submit **now**, but only if target is reached
  - E.g. you could offer to sell relatively **cheaply** if price falls
  - Limit Order would execute **immediately** and that’s not what we want
![](/assets/cryptocurrency-exchanges-stop-loss-order-01.png)


# Arbitrage
- Exploiting **price differences**between **currency pairs** and **exchanges**
  - Buy Bitcoin **cheaply** on one exchange, then send to another where it’s **more expensive** (due to lack of sellers)
  - **Triangular arbitrage** is where an **intermediate pair** allows you to get a better price than between the two original pairs
- **Helps normalize the price across pairs and exchanges**
- Opportunities are **short-lived** and the differences - **small**
  - Usually done by **bots**
  - **Lots of capital needed**to actually make a reasonable profit
  - If you see a **big difference**that is **lasting for hours**, odds are some **exchange has crashed**and it’s not possible to trade there
