##Stock exchange analysis
Trading on exchanges and taking trading decisions is a very hard and complex job. There are two main types of analysis that help traders make decisions: fundamental and technical analysis. 
- Fundamental Analysis
Fundamental analysis is the cornerstone of investing. In global scope it takes into account all factors from real economy which form the value of the analyzed asset. In fact, some would say that you aren't really investing if you aren't performing fundamental analysis.
Many traditional analysts say that crypto coins aren`t real assets like gold for example. They think that only human`s greed and psychology factors drive the prices. But this is very superficial opinion. Crypto currencies has real value because they bring the real benefits. Many of them (like Bitcoin) can transfer value on chipper prices than alternatives using fiat. Some blockchains (like Ethereum) offers opportunity to running smart contracts and DAPPs. Another coins give access to the real utilities. For example, with LookTrip`s LOC coins people can book hotel room without commissions.  It brings a unique benefits for the crypto currency possessors. Using’s of this system will reflect in the price movements. Behind the crypto coins stay a technology and if somebody wants to use it he must buy coins. The price of cryptos depends on the technology used in their blockchain. So if you want to make long term investments in cryptos the most important factor that must be taken into account is the quality of technology behind the coins. Many serious crypto investors said: I believe in technology! And this technology is 100% real asset. For example the development of the Lighting network push the price of the Bitcoin higher and this is logical because if you want to use lighting cannels you must lock bitcoins. Never spend your money for projects with good-for-nothing technology! This is money thrown on the wind. 
Second main factor influence the prices of crypto coins is adoption. As more people and countries adopt the using of cryptos the as higher will go the prices of coins. This is a consequence of the laws of demand and supply. 
Technical Analysis
Technical analyzations, or chartists, analyzing statistics gathered from trading activity, such as price movements and volume. This is a method of analyzing financial markets that tries to solve players' psychology. 
First main type of technical analysis is using of mathematical technical indicators. Mathematical analysis use a series of mathematical calculations applied on the data taken from the charts. The goal of this is to predict where and in which direction the price will move in the future. The indicators attempts to catch a mathematical relationships between the future and past prices. There are dozens and hundreds of indicators in the toolbox of technical analysts. These indicators can be classified as trendfollowing and oscillators. 
With oscillators the analyzers try to catch the overbought and oversold levels of prices. When the value of the oscillator approaches the upper extreme value, analysts interpret that information to mean that the asset is overbought, and as it approaches the lower extreme, analysts consider the asset to be oversold. Examples of oscillators are MACD, stochastic oscillator, RSI e.t.c. 

They are form of interpretation of price and volume charts
The next large group of technical analysis tools are the so-called chart patterns. They are part of the classical technical analysis. 
The technical analysis isn`t an officially recognized science but the most known authors divided patterns into three groups: trend-confirming (continuation),  turning (reversal) and bilateral figures.
The most common continuation chart patterns are Wedge (Falling or Rising), Rectangle (Bullish or Bearish), Pennant (Bullish or Bearish) etc. 
The reversed figures includes the following patterns: Double Top or Double Bottom, Head and Shoulders or Inversive Head and Shoulders, Rising Wedge or Falling Wedge etc. 
The group of Bilateral Patterns included patterns possibly following into two scenarios depending on the direction of the price break.
