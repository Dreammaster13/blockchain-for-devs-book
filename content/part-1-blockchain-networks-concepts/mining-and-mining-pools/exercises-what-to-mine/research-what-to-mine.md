In this exercise you will learn how to choose the **optimal
cryptocurrency to mine**. There is many and many coins in the world of
cryptocurrencies, but which of them is the best for your hardware. We
will look for the answer of this question on web site

Visit "Whattomine"
------------------

5.  You can **change** the **sorting criteria** from drop-down list
    "**Sort by**". This is important to choose the right options. For
    example, if you use profitability for last 24h, this will show the
    most **actual** currencies, but while you manage to mine the coins,
    the leadership can be already changed. The longest periods like last
    3 or 7 days give you the more **stabile** picture of mining
    situation.

    calculations**. The more longest period -- the more stable picture.

    criteria. Remember that not always the leader is the best choice and
    very often the doubtful coins are very attractive but for a **very
    short time**.
