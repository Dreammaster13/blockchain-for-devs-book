# What is Mining?

As we covered in the previous chapter ([Consensus Algorithms](/content/part-1-blockchain-networks-concepts/consensus-algorithms/overview.md)), mining is one possible way to protect the network against [Sybil attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_attack), by letting the network participants "vote" in proportion to their computational power, thus making it expensive to gain network majority by creating "fake accounts".

If you're wondering why it's called "mining", it's because it's also the process by which new coins are created and put in circulation - so in this way it's similar to e.g. mining gold, except here we're "mining" virtual coins.
