# Exercises: Mine Monero in a Pool

In this exercise you will learn how to mine **Monero** with
"**XMR-stak**" miner in **Nanopool**. XMR-Stak is a universal Stratum
pool miner. This miner supports CPUs, AMD and NVIDIA gpus and can be
used to mine the crypto currency Monero and Aeon. Monero is a **Proof of
Work** cryptocurrency that can be mine with computational power from a
**CPU** or **GPU**. It uses the **CryptoNight hashing algorithm**. This
time we will mine it with CPU. There are currently no ASICs for Monero,
which means that anyone with a computer can mine it.

First you will need "**XMR-stak**" miner.

Download "XMR-stak" Miner
-------------------------

1.  Go to "Nanopool" Monero mining <https://xmr.nanopool.org/help> and
    download "**XMR-stak**":

2.  Now you need monero wallet. Go to <https://mymonero.com/#/> and
    **Create an account**.

Setup the Miner
---------------

1.  Let\`s **setup** **the "XMR-stak".** Open the file **"start.bat"**
    with your preferred text editor. In this exercise we will mine
    Monero in "**Nanopool**" pool. Make the "**start.bat**" looks like
    this:

    -   YOUR\_WALLET\_ADDRESS - your valid Monero address.

    -   YOUR\_PAYMENT\_ID - your payment-ID(PAYLOAD). Optional. Use 0
        for local wallet.

    -   YOUR\_WORKER\_NAME - simple short worker name (like worker01).
        Optional.

    -   YOUR\_EMAIL - your email address for notifications. Optional.

2.  **Save** the "**start.bat**".

Mine Monero Coins
-----------------

1.  Start **"XMR-stak"** by double click the file **"start.bat"**.

3.  After connected to "Nanopool" the miner starts receiving "new jobs"
    from the pool.

4.  Also, you can see the information about **Hashrate**. In runtime you
    can press **"h"** key to see the speed statistics anytime.

Let\`s See the Pool Statistics. 
--------------------------------

1.  Go to <https://xmr.nanopool.org/> , paste the address in the upper
    right corner and click on **search**.

2.  After you mined your first block here you can see the variety of
    statistics.

Experiment with the Miner
-------------------------

1.  What is your **hash rate**?

2.  How many XMR (**Monero**) you can mine for 24 hours?

What to Submit?
===============

Create a **zip file** (e.g. **your-name-monero-mining-exercise.zip**)
holding the screenshots of your mining and the log file.

Submit your zip file as **homework** at the course Web site.
