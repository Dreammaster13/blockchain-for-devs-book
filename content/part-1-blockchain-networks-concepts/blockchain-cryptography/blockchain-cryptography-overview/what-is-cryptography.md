# What is Cryptography?

**Cryptography **is the science of providing **security **and **protection **of information.

Cryptography deals with **storing and transmitting data in a secure way**, such that only those, for whom it is intended, can read and process it. This may involve **encrypting and decrypting data** using symmetric or asymmetric encryption schemes \(like AES and RSA\), where one or more **keys** are used to transform data from plain to encrypted form and back.

Cryptography defines **key-exchange algorithms** \(like Diffie-Hellman key exchange\), used to securely exchange data encryption keys between two parties that intend to transmit messages securely using **encryption**.

Cryptography deals with **keys** \(large secret numbers\) and in many scenarios these **keys are derived **from numbers, passwords or passphrases using **key derivation algorithms** \(like PBKDF2 and Scrypt\).

Cryptography uses **random numbers** and deals with entropy and secure generation of random numbers.

Cryptography provides **data hashing** functions \(like SHA-256, SHA3-256 and RIPEMD-160\) which produce message digest, which cannot be reversed back to the original message.

Cryptography provides means of **digital signing of messages** which guarantee message authenticity, integrity and non-repudiation. Most digital signature algorithms \(like DSA, ECDSA and EdDSA\) use **asymmetric key pair** \(private and public key\): the message is **signed** by the private key and the signature is **verified** by the corresponding public key.

**Cryptography in the blockchain** networks deals also with **crypto wallets**, hierarchical key derivation, blockchain addresses, merkle trees, and many other blockchain specific crypto algorithms, standards and protocols.
