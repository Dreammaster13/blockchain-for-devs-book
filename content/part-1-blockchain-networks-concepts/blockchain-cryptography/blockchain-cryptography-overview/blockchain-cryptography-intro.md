# Cryptography - Overview

In this topic we shall introduce basic **cryptography concepts** like cryptographic **hash functions** \(SHA-256, SHA3, RIPEMD and others\), **HMAC** \(hashed message authentication code\), password to **key derivation**, the Diffie-Hellman key-exchange protocol, **symmetric key** encryption schemes \(like the **AES **cipher\) and **asymmetric key** encryption schemes \(like the **RSA **cipher\), as well as the concept of **entropy** and secure **random number** generation.
