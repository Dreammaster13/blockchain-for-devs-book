# Hashing and Hash Functions

In computer programming **hash functions **map text values to numbers.

In cryptography **hash functions**: map input data of arbitrary size to result of fixed size, which is called **hash value** \(or hash code, message digest, or simply hash\).

Cryptographic hash functions are **irreversible by design**, which means that there is no fast algorithm to reproduce the input message from its hash value.

**Hash functions** are widely used in cryptography, in programming and in blockchain systems.
