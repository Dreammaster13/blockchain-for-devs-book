# Exercises: Create Simple Casino (using Solidity, Truffle, MetaMask, Oraclize and IPFS)

We are going to create a **decentralized casino application** where
users are able to bet money for a number between **1 and 10** and if
they are correct, they win a portion of all the ether money staked after
100 total bets.

**Oraclize** is the leading **oracle** service for smart contracts and
blockchain applications, serving thousands of requests for day every day
on **Ethereum**, **Bitcoin** (Rootstock). In the **blockchain** space,
an **oracle** is a party, which provides **real world data**. The need
for such figure arise from the fact that blockchain applications, such
as Bitcoin scripts and smart contracts cannot access and fetch directly
the data they require: price feeds for assets and financial
applications; weather-related information for peer-to-peer insurance;
random number generation for gambling.

Setup the Project
-----------------

1.  Create a folder called Simple-Casino and inside open command line
    and execute the command: **npm init**

2.  After that:

  -------------------
  npm i --D truffle
  -------------------

to install the contract's framework truffle in this project as a
developing dependency

3.  Then execute:

  --------------
  truffle init
  --------------

This will start the project.

4.  Then:

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  npm i -D webpack react react-dom babel-core babel-loader babel-preset-react babel-preset-es2015 babel-preset-stage-2 css-loader style-loader json-loader web3
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5.  After you finished downloading the node modules, go to your project
    folder and create a **webpack.config.js** file. This is the file
    that will combine all of our JavaScript files and css to create a
    single file **build.js** that will hold all the JavaScript code in
    one place and paste the following code in it:

6.  Create the folder **src/** in the project and inside that folder,
    create the folders **js/** and inside it create **index.js** and
    **css/** and inside it create **index.css** to organize the source
    code

7.  **index.css**

8.  Finally create folder **dist/** in the root folder and in this
    folder create **index.html** and paste the following code in it:

9.  The **\<div id=\"root\"\>\</div\>** is where the react code will be
    inserted and the **\<script src=\"build.js\"\>\</script\>** to
    include the build file generated by webpack.

Create Smart Contracts
----------------------

1.  Create the file **contracts/Casino.sol**, this is the main Solidity
    contract that we will be writing

2.  We will use **oracalizeAPI** so we should install it in our project.
    Go to **contracts/** folder and run the following command:

  ------------------------------
  truffle install oraclize-api
  ------------------------------

3.  A new folder will appear in the casino directory, named
    **"installed\_contracts"**. We should import usingOraclize contract
    in our Casino contract. The Casino contract will **inherit** the
    **usingOraclize** contract. Casino contract will have:

    -   **address** of the owner

    -   **minimum bet** (default **0.1 ether**) -- minimum bet a user
        has to make

    -   **total bet** -- total amount of Ether bet for this current game

    -   **number of bets** -- how many bets the users have made

    -   **maximum bets (**default **10 ether)**-- maximum amount of bets
        can be made for each game

    -   **limit amount bets (100)**-- max amount of bets that cannot be
        exceeded to avoid excessive gas consumption

    -   **number winner** -- number that won the last game

    -   **array of all the players**

    -   **structure, storing for each number the players who bet on it**

    -   **structure, storing each player's number he bet on**

    -   **function modifier**, allowing the execution of functions when
        the bets are completed

4.  Go to the **migrations/** folder and create the file
    **2\_deploy\_contracts.js** and write the code below which

    -   First, we require the Casino.sol contract.

    -   Then, in the .deploy() method we specify the minimum bet, in
        this case it's 0.1 ether converted to wei with that function

    -   100 is the max amount of players

    -   Finally the gas limit that we are willing to use to deploy the
        contract

5.  Open **truffle.js** from the root folder and customize your Truffle
    configuration

    ![](/assets/exercises-decentralized-casino-metamask-oraclize-07.png)

6.  Now create the constructor that is used to configure the minimum bet
    per game and the max amount of bets. The minimum bet that each user
    has to make in order to participate in the game. The max amount of
    bets that are required for each game:

![](/assets/exercises-decentralized-casino-metamask-oraclize-08.png)

7.  Set the proof of **oraclize** in order to make secure random number
    generations in the constructor:

![](/assets/exercises-decentralized-casino-metamask-oraclize-010.png)

9.  We have the **checkPlayerExists(address)** function, which checks if
    the player exists in the game.

10. We should generate winner number by using oraclize function
    **oraclize\_newRandomDSQuery** which takes **delay**,
    **numberRandomBytes** and **callbackGas:**

> ![](/assets/exercises-decentralized-casino-metamask-oraclize-011.png)

11. We should create a **callback** function which gets called by
    oraclize when the random number is generated, it gets the
    \_**queryId** that was generated to proofVerify, the **\_result**
    string that contains the number generated and **\_proof** string
    with a proof code to verify the authenticity of the number
    generation

12. Finally, we should create the function to send the corresponding
    Ether to each winner then deletes all the players for the next game
    and resets the **total bet** and **number of bets**:

Deploy the application online with IPFS
---------------------------------------

1.  First install **webpack** to generate the **build.js** file which
    will contain all the js, css and html files.

2.  Install webpack by **npm install -g webpack**

  -------------------------
  npm install --g webpack
  -------------------------

Go to the directory **casino/** and then run**:**

  ---------
  webpack
  ---------

3.  Open another command line and run:

  ---------
  testrpc
  ---------

4.  Then go to the **src/** folder and

  -----------------
  truffle compile
  -----------------

and then:

  -----------------
  truffle migrate
  -----------------

> to compile and migrate the contracts.

5.  Go to <https://dist.ipfs.io/#go-ipfs> and download the go-ipfs then
    extract it

6.  Either add ipfs as a path variable or go to the ipfs folder and run
    in Command Prompt **ipfs init**

7.  Open command line and type **ipfs daemon** and this will create node

8.  Then open another command line and type:

  ------------------
  ipfs swarm peers
  ------------------

This will get you peers that will share your content.

9.  Get the path of your **dist/** folder and run the command:

  -----------------------------------------
  ipfs add --r \<dist\_folder\_location\>
  -----------------------------------------

This will add your folder to the network. You will see a long hash,
which has been generated for you.

10. Copy the last hash. For example
    **"QmUCjkUigBFw4RuTLwUajvQ5q8QMqmFHpmAiTBhLVosEcR":**

![](/assets/exercises-decentralized-casino-metamask-oraclize-03.png)

11. Run the following command:

  ---------------------------------------------
  ipfs name publish \<hash\_of\_dir\_folder\>
  ---------------------------------------------

![](/assets/exercises-decentralized-casino-metamask-oraclize-04.png)

12. Open the following link. For example:
    **<https://gateway.ipfs.io/ipfs/QmUCjkUigBFw4RuTLwUajvQ5q8QMqmFHpmAiTBhLVosEcR>
    **

13. If you make changes to your files remember to execute **webpack**
    then **ipfs add --r \<your\_location\>** and **ipfs name publish
    \<hash\_of\_dir\_folder\>**. The publish name hash is always the
    same:

14. Play with the Dapp.

15. The app should look like this go and play with it:

What to Submit?
===============

Submit as exercise outcome the .**txt file with the URL after it is
uploaded to ipfs.**

**Example**:
[**https://gateway.ipfs.io/ipfs/QmUCjkUigBFw4RuTLwUajvQ5q8QMqmFHpmAiTBhLVosEcR**](https://gateway.ipfs.io/ipfs/QmUCjkUigBFw4RuTLwUajvQ5q8QMqmFHpmAiTBhLVosEcR)
