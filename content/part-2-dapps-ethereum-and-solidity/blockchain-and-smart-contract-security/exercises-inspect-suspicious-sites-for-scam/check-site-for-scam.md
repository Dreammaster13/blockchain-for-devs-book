# Exercises: Check Suspicious Sites for Scam

In this Exercise we are going to be learning how to inspect suspicious
web sites for scam. We will use **MetaMask** and Google Chrome app
**EtherAddressLookup**. During the exercise you will install
**MetaMask** and **EtherAddressLookup** and check some suspicious
sites. 

Install MetaMask 
-----------------

1.  If you already have MetaMask installed you can skip this step.

    Open **Chrome** and go to **https://metamask.io**. Click on the
    **Get Chrome Extension**.

3.  Now **MetaMask** is checking the sites you visit. For example, try
    to visit <https://iost.co> with Google Chrome with MetaMask
    installed. The extension will redirect you to
    <https://metamask.io/phishing.html> and show you attention message.

4.  If you try to visit the same site with clear Firefox, the site will
    be opened.

5.  Another example: If you try to open site **xn\--polonix-ws4c.com**
    the MetaMask will stop it.

6.  But clear Firefox without MetaMask will open the **fake poloniex.com
    site**. Note: the **character 'e' is not the ASCII (Dec 101)
    character 'e'** this character has a little dot from below.
    Characters interchange is a common approach for phishing. Always
    check the site names and prefer to use google to find sites instead
    click on links.

Use EtherAddressLookup
----------------------

1.  Another useful tool against scam sites is **EtherAddressLookup.**

    Go to <https://etherscamdb.info/> and take a look at the **scam
    sites database**. This database was created in 2017 by \#TeamMEW
    when trying to find a solution to the ethereum scams. Of course,
    grouping all the scams won\'t make them go away, but it will make
    identifying them and taking them down easier.

2.  If you want to interact with this black list you can do this very
    easily by downloading the Google Chrome app **EtherAddressLookup**.
