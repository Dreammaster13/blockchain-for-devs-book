# What is Truffle
Truffle is framework for smart-contract development. With Truffle you can compile, deploy, test and make a User Interface for your smart contract. It is very useful when you have many contracts and complex architecture, because you can automate some processes. 

Truffle has a package manager called **EthPm** which can help you to install libraries easier. It follows the **ERC190**[^1] standards for publishing and consuming smart-contract packages. Also we have a **truffle console** that is similar to the **geth console** and you can interact with the contract faster.

[^1]: ERC stands for Ethereum Request for Comment and it is a proposal for improving the ecosystem.
